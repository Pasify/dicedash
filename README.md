# DICE DASH
The Game is a simple dice game in which players take turns rolling a single die to score points. The goal of the game is to be the first player to reach a certain number of points, typically 100.

# How to Play
- The game can be played with two or more players. On each turn, a player rolls a single die as many times as they wish, adding up the numbers rolled each time.
- However, if the player rolls a 1, they lose all the points they have accumulated in that turn and their turn is over.
- After each roll, the player can choose to hold and add their points to their total score, or they can choose to roll again to try to score more points.
- The first player to reach the agreed-upon winning score (usually 100 points) wins the game.
